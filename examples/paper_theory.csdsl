    <DEFINE_SECTION_TITLE>Theory and Development of CSDSLs</DEFINE_SECTION_TITLE>
    <DEFINE_SECTION_CONTENT>Write a detailed section on the theory and development of CSDSLs. Discuss the theoretical framework behind CSDSLs, explaining how they were developed and their underlying principles. Explain how CSDSLs function to improve communication with LLMs by providing a structured format for interactions, thereby making them more effective and contextually aware. Elaborate on how CSDSLs help to tailor the LLMs to specific needs and domains, and describe the process of defining and implementing CSDSLs.</DEFINE_SECTION_CONTENT>
